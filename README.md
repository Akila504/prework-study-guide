# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 
The motivation behind the study guide is to make it easy for the student to take notes as they go throughout the bootcamp, as well as to get to understand some of the fundamentals of HTML,CSS, GIT and Javascript.

Through this project, new knowledge relating to JS, CSS and HTML were aquired, for example how functions can be called within the console of the webpage, the need to have control flow to make it all possible. Another, important lesson learned is version control through git and github and usign pullrequest to merge the main branches with the feature branches.
